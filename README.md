# Crack-Detection-on-Structures
This project aims to develop an advanced crack detection system by integrating a U-Net deep learning model with real-time camera feeds for continuous infrastructure monitoring. Cracks in structures such as bridges, roads, and buildings pose significant risks, making timely detection crucial for maintenance and safety.
